# First_login_page
here i made a login page using basic css and html . firstly you will see a simple menu bar and after that you will see some description about that site , i added some random texts copied from some random article . then at bottom you will be seeing some footer with a little info . it took me 2 days to make it cause i am new in this . but learned new things while making it
